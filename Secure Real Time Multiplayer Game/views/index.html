      <h3>User Stories</h3>
      Develop a 2D real time multiplayer game using the HTML Canvas API and <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>. The game can be as simple or complex as you like, as long as all the following user stories are implemented.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Multiple players can connect to a server and play.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player has an avatar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player is represented by an object created by the <code>Player</code> class in <code>Player.mjs</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          At a minimum, each player object should contain a unique <code>id</code>, a <code>score</code>, along with 
          <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates representing the player's current position.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game has at least one type of collectible item. Complete the <code>Collectible</code> class in 
          <code>Collectible.mjs</code> to implement this.
        </li>
        <li>
          At a minimum, each collectible item object created by the <code>Collectible</code> class should contain 
          a unique <code>id</code>, along with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates representing the item's 
          current position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players can use the WASD and/or arrow keys to move their avatar. Complete the <code>movePlayer</code> 
          method in <code>Player.mjs</code> to implement this.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>movePlayer</code> method should accept two arguments: a string of "up", "down", "left", or "right", 
          and a number for the amount of pixels the player's position should change. <code>movePlayer</code> should 
          adjust the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the player object it's called from.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player's score should be used to calculate their rank among the other players. Complete the 
          <code>calculateRank</code> method in the <code>Player</code> class to implement this.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>calculateRank</code> method should accept an array of objects representing all connected players 
          and return the string <code>Rank: currentRanking/totalPlayers</code>. For example, in a game with two players, 
          if Player A has a score of 3 and Player B has a score of 5, <code>calculateRank</code> for Player A should 
          return <code>Rank: 2/2</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players can collide with a collectible item. Complete the <code>collision</code> method in 
          <code>Player.mjs</code> to implement this.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>collision</code> method should accept a collectible item's object as an argument. If the player's 
          avatar intersects with the item, the <code>collision</code> method should return <code>true</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          All players are kept in sync.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players can disconnect from the game at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prevent the client from trying to guess / sniff the MIME type.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nothing from the website is cached in the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          The headers say that the site is powered by "PHP 7.4.3" even though it isn't (as a security measure).
        </li>
      </ol>
